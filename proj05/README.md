Use a servo motor to make a mechanical gauge to point to everywhere you want.
Servo motors are a special type of motor that don't spin around in a circle, but move to a specific position and stay there until you tell them to move again (Servo usually only rotate 180 degrees).

What you need:
- Potentiometer
- Servo motor
- Motor arm
- 100uF capacitor
